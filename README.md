# Battlefield 1942 Forgotten Hope Single Player

## Purpose

This repository is a collection of work on improving Single Player/CO-OP mode in the Battlefield 1942 mod: Forgotten Hope.

These improvements are tested compatible with the last official release of Forgotten Hope: version 0.7.

The aim of this work is to provide better bot support for Forgotten Hope in several forms:

1. As a set of changes that can be imported into any other mods based on Forgotten Hope (this repo)
2. As a mini-mod (eventually)
3. As a server-side mod (SSM) (hopefully)

Out of scope:

* Non-SP fixes
* New content
* Fixes for other mods based on FH (but see point 1. above)

Possible future scope:

* FH-based fan maps and map packs
